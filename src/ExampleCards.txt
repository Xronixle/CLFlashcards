# This is an example flashcard txt file to showcase what all is done.
# As already shown here, lines that start with a # will not be used at all.
# If there is a # on a line that has data, it will be used however.


# Categories are defined by double slashes (//) and a space:
# // ExampleCategory

# Everything under a defined category will be added as its own entry into the said category.
# The separation matters here; " - " is the separator of choice with each entry looking like this:
# ExampleQuestion - ExampleAnswer - ExampleSource


# A source may not be included, and that's fine. The things that are necessary though are a question and answer.
# If you require that your answer has a newline character (\n), add it by doing two pipes (||) and it'll be converted into \n.
# If any random data is found in a file that isn't commented out, it'll probably lead to some errors. Please be careful!

# Feel free to run the program and input "ExampleCards.txt" to see the data work below.
