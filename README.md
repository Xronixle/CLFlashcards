# CLFlashcards
CLFlashcards is a flashcards program meant to be ran in a command-line interface (CLI).

This entire project was made in around 2 hours for personal use, however I wanted to put it on Github mainly so I could retrieve a copy of it on other devices if necessary.
The main benefit of this program is that it can be used offline on a computer instead of needing an internet connection for something like Quizlet.

If you personally don't care for a good user interface (and probably a good user experience), feel free to use this basic project.

To get started, check out the "ExampleCards.txt" file to see how files should be handled to create flashcards.
